To make it easy for others to download all the dependencies for your React Native project, you simply need to share the project's **`package.json`** file and instruct them to run the correct installation command.

The `package.json` file automatically lists all the project's dependencies, and tools like npm or Yarn use this file to install everything required.

### 1\. Ensure `package.json` is Correct üìÑ

When you push your code to GitHub, ensure the `package.json` file is included. It should contain two important sections:

  * `dependencies`: All the libraries your app needs to run in production.
  * `devDependencies`: Libraries needed for development (e.g., testing tools, linters).

Your dependencies will automatically be managed in this file whenever you use a command like `npm install your-package-name` or `yarn add your-package-name`.

### 2\. Provide Clear Instructions üìù

In your repository's `README.md` file, you should provide clear, simple instructions for setup. This is the single most important step for making it easy for others. The instructions should be easy to copy and paste.

Here is a template you can use for your `README.md`:

-----

# Project Name

A brief description of your project.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine.
## Server (MongoDB API)

This repo now includes a small API server under `server/` that:
- Seeds the database with Mysuru places on first start (if empty)
- Exposes `GET /api/places` to return all places (title, lat, lng, badge, tagCode)
- Exposes validation endpoints for stamping via QR or Tag:
  - `POST /api/validate/qr { placeId, qrToken }`
  - `POST /api/validate/tag { placeId, tagCode }`

Run it locally:
1. Copy `server/.env.example` to `server/.env` and fill `MONGODB_URI` with your credentials.
2. Install and start:
   - Windows PowerShell
     ```powershell
     cd 'c:\Users\ajith\RPA\Ambari\server'
     npm install
     npm start
     ```
3. Test:
   ```powershell
   curl http://localhost:4000/api/health
   curl http://localhost:4000/api/places
   ```

### MongoDB Schemas (desired)

Place document
- title: string (required)
- latitude: number (required)
- longitude: number (required)
- badge: string (required) ‚Äì identifier for the badge/stamp (can also be an asset key or URL)
- tagCode: string (required) ‚Äì NFC/tag short code used for validation at the site
- qrToken: string (required) ‚Äì the QR token to validate scans
- description: string (optional)

Checkin document
- placeId: ObjectId (required) ‚Äì reference to Place _id
- tagCode: string (optional)
- qrToken: string (optional)
- createdAt: Date (required)
- userId: string (optional)

### App integration

- Home screen fetches places from `http://localhost:4000/api/places` (Android emulator uses `http://10.0.2.2:4000`).
- Markers open a popup; tapping a marker in the app navigates to the Scan view.
- You can extend the flow to call `validate/qr` or `validate/tag` before granting the local stamp.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed on your system:

  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
  * [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install project dependencies:**
    This command will read the `package.json` file and download all the necessary libraries.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the App

1.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```

2.  **Run on a device or simulator:**

      * **Scan the QR code** with the [Expo Go app](https://expo.dev/go) on your phone.
      * Press **`i`** in your terminal to open the iOS simulator.
      * Press **`a`** in your terminal to open the Android emulator.

By following these steps, anyone with the prerequisites can easily set up and run your project without manually tracking down each dependency.
